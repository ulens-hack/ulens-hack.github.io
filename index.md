# Welcome

This hack session will focus on unsolved problems in modeling
microlensing events. It will be held jointly with the annual
microlensing workshop. The primary goal of the hack session is to
engage people outside the traditional microlensing community in open
problems in microlensing research.

Open problems include:
* How to efficiently search a complex (non-Gaussian) multi-variate parameter space.
* How to weight degenerate solutions?
* Efficient computational methods for solving the triple lens equation

See the [projects](/projects/) page for more detailed descriptions. 

The [resources](/resources/) page has a list of useful references
including links to public tools and datasets.

# Logistics

The 23rd Microlensing Workshop and Hack Session will be held **January
28, 2019 -- February 1, 2019 at the [Center for Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)
in New York City**. The Workshop will be held the first 2.5 days
(Monday through Wednesday morning) including some introductory
material for the Hack Session. The last 2.5 days (Wednesday afternoon
through Friday) will be devoted to hacking.  A
[tentative schedule is available here](/schedule/).

Hack Session participants
are encouraged to attend the full week to get a fully immersive
introduction to microlensing. However, for those who are unable to
attend the full week but would still like to participate in the Hack
Session, there will be an option to attend just the Hack Session from
Wednesday -- Friday. We will endeavor to make relevant introductory
material available beforehand.

To register for the Conference (including the Hack Session), please
visit the main conference website (TBD). To receive a notification
when registration opens, please [sign up for the ulens-hack GitHub
organization](https://github.com/ulens-hack).

## Code of Conduct

The organizers are committed to making this meeting productive and
enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or

Please follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or

  includes sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo,
  deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of

  appearance, body size, race, or religion.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
 including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
 imagery is not appropriate.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
  attendees. Critique ideas, not people.

- If participants wish to share photos or contents of talks/slides of
any attendee or speaker on social media, we ask that they first get
permission.

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to
comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a
refund of any charge.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is
asked to speak, in confidence, to [TBD man] and [TBD woman].

This code of conduct is based on the "London Code of Conduct", as
originally designed for the conference "Accurate Astrophysics. Correct
Cosmology", held in London in July 2015.
