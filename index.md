# Welcome

This hack session will focus on unsolved problems in modeling
microlensing events. It will be held jointly with the annual
microlensing workshop. The primary goal of the hack session is to
engage people outside the traditional microlensing community in open
problems in microlensing research.

Open problems include:
* How to efficiently search a complex (non-Gaussian) multi-variate parameter space.
* How to weight degenerate solutions?
* Efficient computational methods for solving the triple lens equation

See the [projects](/projects/) page for more detailed descriptions. 

The [resources](/resources/) page has a list of useful references
including links to public tools and datasets.

# Logistics

[Microlensing 23](https://microlensing.science/23/) will be held **January 28, 2019 -- February 1, 2019 at
the [Center for Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)
in New York City**. A scientific conference will be held the first 2.5
days (Monday through Wednesday morning). The last 2.5 days (Wednesday
afternoon through Friday) will be devoted to hacking.  A [tentative
schedule is available here](/schedule/).

Hack Session participants are welcome and encouraged to attend the
full week to get a fully immersive introduction to microlensing. Many
of the talks will cover recent analyses of microlensing data,
including ongoing challenges, which will provide a sense of the state
of the field. However, it is not necessary to attend the conference in
order to participate in the hack session.

To register for the Conference and/or Hack Session, please visit the
main conference website (https://microlensing.science/23/). To receive
a notification when registration opens, please go to

# Guidelines for Collaboration

To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the collaboration
policy developed for the Gaia Sprints. This policy recommends that
participants agree to the following:

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise,
code, and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open,
among participants and in the world.

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations,
and combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a
project can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
participant who gets significant contributions to a project is expected
to include those contributors as co-authors.

These rules make it inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

# Be a Nice Person

## Code of Conduct

The organizers are committed to making this meeting productive and
enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or
religion. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Please follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment
  includes sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo,
  deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of
  an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments
  related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
 including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
 imagery is not appropriate.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
  attendees. Critique ideas, not people.

- *Social Media Policy* If any attendee asks that something not be
shared on social media, respect that request. If you are presenting
anything that you do not want shared on social media, simply inform
other participants clearly that they should not share it, for example,
by putting the request on a slide at the beginning of the talk.

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to
comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a
refund of any charge.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is
asked to speak, in confidence, to [TBD man] and [TBD woman].

This code of conduct is based on the "London Code of Conduct", as
originally designed for the conference "Accurate Astrophysics. Correct
Cosmology", held in London in July 2015.
