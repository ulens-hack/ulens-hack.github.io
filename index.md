# Welcome

This hack session will focus on unsolved problems in modeling
microlensing events. It will be held jointly with the annual
microlensing workshop. The primary goal of the hack session is to
engage people outside the traditional microlensing community in open
problems in microlensing research.

Open problems include:
* How to efficiently search a complex (non-Gaussian) multi-variate parameter space.
* How to weight degenerate solutions?
* Efficient computational methods for solving the triple lens equation

See [below](#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-hack-session-how-does-it-work) and the [projects](/projects/) page for more detailed descriptions. 

The [resources](/resources/) page has a list of useful references
including links to public tools and datasets.

# Logistics

[Microlensing 23](https://microlensing.science/23/) will be held **January 28, 2019 -- February 1, 2019 at
the [Center for Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)
in New York City**. A scientific conference will be held the first 2.5
days (Monday through Wednesday morning). The last 2.5 days (Wednesday
afternoon through Friday) will be devoted to hacking.  [The draft
SCHEDULE is available here](/schedule/).

Hack Session participants are welcome and encouraged to attend the
full week to get a fully immersive introduction to microlensing. Many
of the talks will cover recent analyses of microlensing data,
including ongoing challenges, which will provide a sense of the state
of the field. However, it is not necessary to attend the conference in
order to participate in the hack session.

To register for the Conference and/or Hack Session, please visit the
[main conference website](https://microlensing.science/23/). ***Note
registration for the conference is now closed. However, you can still
register for the hack session.

# What is the Purpose of the Hack Session? How Does it Work?

A hack session is an opportunity for focused work on a particular
problem. The goal is to foster novel solutions to problems by bringing
together people with different areas of expertise. In this case, the
goal is to bring together microlensing experts and their knowledge of
modeling and analysis problems in the field with experts in machine
learning, statistics, and mathematics and their knowledge of the
latest techniques for large-scale time-series data analysis, methods
for likelihood maximization, and strategies for computational
challenges related to finding the roots of high-order complex
polynomials.

A hack session is meant to be freeform to allow collaborations to
develop naturally. However, we anticipate two types of work will tend
to dominate:

1. Open discussions of particular unsolved problems. 

To facilitate this, we will be organizing breakout sessions on
Thursday and Friday based on topics brought by participants. These
discussions will be about an hour in length, but may lead to further
collaboration. An appropriate length for introducing a topic would be
5 minutes or less.

2. Focused work (e.g., coding) on a specific project that can be
completed in a two-day timeframe.

For example, at one-day AAS hack sessions, participants have completed
a range of projects from writing a Twitterbot to tweet flight
information for the local airport to writing new modules for the
Python package astropy. In this case, the projects of most interest
will provide opportunities for machine learning or data analysis
experts to apply their expertise.

**It is expected that microlensing participants will bring projects
or topics they would like to work on.** At the same time, they should
also be open to allowing collaborations to take them in new
directions.

For those not familiar with microlensing, this field deals with the
detection of planets in time-series photometric data. It is similar to
Kepler transiting planet searches in the large number of datapoints
(observational cadence of 1/15 min to 1/day for hundreds of millions
of stars) and small number of true positives (dozens per year from the
ground or hundreds from space). It differs from Kepler in that the
signals, modeling, and likelihood surfaces are much more complex.

# Guidelines for Collaboration

To ensure transparency and openness, we have adopted the collaboration
policy developed for the Gaia Sprints. This policy recommends that
participants agree to the following:

All participants will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise,
code, and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open,
among participants and in the world.

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations,
and combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a
project can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
participant who gets significant contributions to a project is expected
to include those contributors as co-authors.

These rules make it inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or
proprietary code, unless the participant bringing such assets has the
rights to open them or add collaborators.

# Be a Nice Person

## Code of Conduct

The organizers are committed to making this meeting productive and
enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or
religion. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Please follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment
  includes sustained disruption of talks or other events,
  inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo,
  deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of
  an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments
  related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
 including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
 imagery is not appropriate.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
  attendees. Critique ideas, not people.

- *Social Media Policy* If any attendee asks that something not be
shared on social media, respect that request. If you are presenting
anything that you do not want shared on social media, simply inform
other participants clearly that they should not share it, for example,
by putting the request on a slide at the beginning of the talk.

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to
comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a
refund of any charge.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is
asked to speak, in confidence, to Calen Henderson
<chenderson@ipac.caltech.edu> and/or Rachel Street
<rstreet@lco.global>. 

The contact people are volunteers without formal
training who can't give legal advice.  Their role is to provide
support and to facilitate concerns being addressed.  Anyone with
concerns is encouraged to speak to one of the contact people and may
do so confidentially to request advice, which will be their personal
interpretation and guidance.  Both the person reporting a concern and
the contact person should write down a full description of their
concern or incident as soon as possible after the event.  The contact
person will not share that information with anyone without the
permission of the person reporting a concern.  The contact person may,
if the reporting person is willing and the contact person feels
comfortable doing do, discuss the issue with someone named in the
complaint and/or the other contact person. If so, these conversations
should also be documented.  If the reporting person wishes to make a
formal complaint, they or the contact person will contact
<codeofconduct@simonsfoundation.org>, and provide the documentation
described above.

This code of conduct is based on the "London Code of Conduct", as
originally designed for the conference "Accurate Astrophysics. Correct
Cosmology", held in London in July 2015.
