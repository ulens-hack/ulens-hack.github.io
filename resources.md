# Public Code

## [MulensModel](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel/)

[Documentation](https://rpoleski.github.io/MulensModel/) includes a few tutorials. See also [examples/ directory](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel/tree/master/examples) for codes that show how to fit the model, plot the model light curve, read data etc. 
For paper presenting the code [click here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01003/) but note that there were many improvements since paper posting.
